Description: Embark on a nostalgic journey with the Classic Snake Game! Maneuver your snake through the game grid, eat the food, and watch your snake grow longer with each bite. But beware, as the longer your snake gets, the harder it becomes to avoid collisions with the walls and your own tail. This timeless arcade game offers simple yet addictive gameplay that will keep you coming back for more!

Rules: The main objective of the Classic Snake Game is to control the snake to eat as much food as possible, growing longer with each item consumed and achieving the highest score. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to change the snake's direction. The snake moves continuously in the chosen direction until you specify a new one. Food items appear randomly on the game grid; guide the snake to these items. When the snake eats the food, it grows longer and your score increases. Be cautious as the snake grows, making it harder to navigate. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls of the game grid or its own body. The challenge is to avoid these collisions while maximizing your score by eating as much food as possible.
