Description: Experience the timeless excitement of the Classic Tetris Game! Arrange the falling Tetriminos to form complete lines and clear the game board. As you progress, the speed increases, challenging your reflexes and strategic thinking. Perfectly balance speed and precision to prevent the stack from reaching the top. This iconic puzzle game offers endless fun and requires both quick decision-making and strategic planning.

Rules: Clear lines by completing horizontal rows of blocks without gaps and prevent the blocks from stacking up to the top of the playfield.The game is played on a vertical grid called the playfield, which is typically 10 blocks wide and 20 blocks tall. Seven different shapes of blocks, called tetrominoes, fall from the top. These shapes are I, J, L, O, S, T, and Z. Players can move the falling tetromino left, right, or down, and rotate it clockwise or counterclockwise to fit it into empty spaces. Tetrominoes fall one at a time from the top of the playfield. When a horizontal line is completely filled with blocks, it clears, and the blocks above it shift down. The game ends if the tetrominoes stack up to the top of the playfield.
